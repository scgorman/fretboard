# Fretboard
Fretboard is a small Python project that was initially aimed at generating a fretboard diagram of any guitar tuning. It's a personal project to help me learn guitar and refresh my rusty programming skills at the same time.

### Objectives:
- Fretboard note visualization based on the amount of guitar strings, the pitches of the guitar strings, and the length of the fretboard
- Chord highlighting, including chord building and chord finders. Open chords, barre chords, power chords, etc.
- Scale highlighting
- Support for capos
